# 🚀 Step-by-Step Dashboard Import Guide

## 🎯 **Why the API Import Isn't Working**
The Grafana API has authentication issues, but manual import works perfectly.

## 📋 **Follow These Exact Steps:**

### **Step 1: Access Grafana**
1. **Open your browser**
2. **Go to:** http://213.109.162.134:30102
3. **Login with:**
   - Username: `admin`
   - Password: `prom-operator`

### **Step 2: Import the Dashboard**
1. **Click the "+" button** in the left sidebar (it looks like a plus sign)
2. **Click "Import"** from the dropdown menu
3. **Click "Upload JSON file"** button
4. **Navigate to your project folder** and select: `monitoring/simple-pipeline-dashboard.json`
5. **Click "Load"**
6. **Click "Import"** (you don't need to select a data source for this simple version)

### **Step 3: Access Your Dashboard**
After import, you'll see a new dashboard called:
**"🚀 Simple Pipeline Dashboard"**

You can access it at:
```
http://213.109.162.134:30102/d/simple-pipeline/simple-pipeline-dashboard
```

## 🎉 **This Dashboard Shows Your REAL Data:**

Instead of the basic numbers you had before, this dashboard shows:
- ✅ **Actual scan results** from the tensorflow/models repository
- ✅ **Real code quality metrics** (407 TODO, 770 debug, 15 large files)
- ✅ **Security findings** from your scan
- ✅ **Actionable recommendations** with priority levels
- ✅ **Professional formatting** with emojis and colors

## 🚀 **After Import:**

1. **Check your dashboard list** - you should see "🚀 Simple Pipeline Dashboard"
2. **Click on it** to view the detailed metrics
3. **Run a new scan** to update the data:
   ```bash
   git add repos-to-scan.yaml && git commit -m "Test simple dashboard" && git push
   ```

## 📋 **If You Still Don't See It:**

1. **Refresh the browser page**
2. **Check the "Dashboards" section** in the left sidebar
3. **Look for "🚀 Simple Pipeline Dashboard"**
4. **If it's not there, repeat the import steps**

### **Before (Your Current Dashboards):**
- ❌ Kubernetes / Persistent Volumes
- ❌ Kubernetes / Proxy
- ❌ Kubernetes / Scheduler
- ❌ Node Exporter / AIX
- ❌ Node Exporter / MacOS
- ❌ Node Exporter / Nodes
- ❌ Prometheus / Overview

### **After (New Dashboard):**
