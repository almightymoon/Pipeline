# ✅ ISSUE RESOLVED - Dashboard Links Fixed & Real Data Implemented

## 🐛 Problems You Reported

1. **Dashboard Links Issue:** Jira was linking to hardcoded neuropilot dashboard instead of repository-specific dashboards
2. **No Real Data:** Grafana dashboards showed placeholder data (zeros) instead of real pipeline metrics
3. **Dashboard Not Found:** Neuropilot-project dashboard didn't exist

## ✅ SOLUTIONS IMPLEMENTED

### 1. **Fixed Dashboard Links** ✅
- **Before:** All repositories → Linked to neuropilot dashboard ❌
- **After:** Each repository → Links to its own dashboard ✅

### 2. **Implemented Real Data** ✅
- **Before:** Dashboard showed zeros ❌
- **After:** Dashboard shows actual pipeline metrics ✅

### 3. **Created Missing Dashboards** ✅
- **Before:** Neuropilot dashboard didn't exist ❌
