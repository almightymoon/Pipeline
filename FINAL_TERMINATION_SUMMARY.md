# âœ… Automatic Termination - Complete!

## What Was Fixed

The webhook was calling the `repository_dispatch` API but the workflow was only listening for `workflow_dispatch`.

**Solution**: Now the workflow accepts **both**:
- `repository_dispatch` (from webhook) âœ…
- `workflow_dispatch` (manual trigger) âœ…

## How It Works Now

```
Click Jira Link â†’ Webhook Server â†’ GitHub API â†’ Workflow Runs Automatically â†’ Deployment Terminated! âœ…
```

## Next Steps

1. **Commit and push** the updated workflow:
```bash
git add .github/workflows/auto-terminate-deployment.yml
git commit -m "Add repository_dispatch support for webhook"
git push
```

2. **Test the termination** again from Jira:
   - The webhook will now properly trigger the workflow
   - The workflow will run automatically
   - Your deployment will be terminated!

## What Will Happen

1. Click termination link in Jira âœ…
2. Webhook receives request âœ…
3. Webhook calls GitHub API âœ…
4. GitHub workflow triggers automatically âœ…
5. Workflow deletes Kubernetes resources âœ…
6. Deployment terminated! ðŸŽ‰

## Verify It Worked

Check your GitHub Actions:
- Go to: https://github.com/almightymoon/Pipeline/actions
- Look for "Auto Terminate Deployment"
- Should show a recent successful run!

The app should now be terminated! ðŸš€
