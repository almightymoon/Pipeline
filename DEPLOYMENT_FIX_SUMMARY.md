# Docker Image Deployment Pipeline - Fix Summary

## Issue Fixed

The GitHub Actions workflow was failing with the error:
```
/home/runner/work/_temp/xxx.sh: line 12: [: 0
0: integer expression expected
ðŸ“Š Found 0
0 images to deploy
Error: Invalid format '0'
```

## Root Cause

The grep command used to count images was:
1. Counting commented/uncommented lines incorrectly
2. Producing multi-line output with extra whitespace
3. Not properly filtering for active vs commented entries

## Solution

### 1. Fixed Image Counting (`read_config` step)
- Changed from grep-based counting to using `yq` to properly parse YAML
- Added proper whitespace trimming
- Now only counts actual active images (not commented)

```bash
# Before
IMAGE_COUNT=$(grep -c "^- image:" images-to-deploy.yaml || echo "0")

# After  
IMAGE_COUNT=$(yq '.images | length // 0' images-to-deploy.yaml 2>/dev/null || echo "0")
IMAGE_COUNT=$(echo "$IMAGE_COUNT" | tr -d '[:space:]')
```

### 2. Improved Image Parsing (`deploy` step)
- Added jq installation for proper JSON parsing
- Parse YAML using yq, then extract fields with jq
- Properly handle namespace from each image config
- Support for multiple namespaces

### 3. Enhanced Status Reporting
- Display status for all namespaces
- Generate comprehensive endpoints file
- Handle multiple namespace deployments

## Files Modified

- `.github/workflows/deploy-docker-images.yml` - Fixed image counting and parsing

## Testing

To test the fix:
1. Edit `images-to-deploy.yaml` with your Docker images
2. Commit and push
3. Check GitHub Actions for successful deployment

## Example Configuration

```yaml
images:
  - image: docker.io/arthurjones/getting-started:latest
    name: my-app
    namespace: production
    port: 3000
    node_port: 30081
    replicas: 1
    environment: production
```

## Next Steps

The pipeline will now:
1. âœ… Properly count images
2. âœ… Parse YAML correctly
3. âœ… Deploy to correct namespaces
4. âœ… Create Jira issues with endpoints
5. âœ… Provide access URLs
