# Docker Hub Integration Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Docker Hub Push Step (.github/workflows/scan-external-repos.yml)
- Line 874-903: Added new step to push Docker images to Docker Hub
- Pushes both versioned tag (run_number) and 'latest' tag
- Outputs Docker Hub image URLs

### 2. Passed Docker Hub Info to Jira Script
- Line 1146-1148: Added DOCKERHUB_IMAGE and DOCKERHUB_IMAGE_LATEST environment variables
- These are passed to the Python script that creates Jira issues

### 3. Updated Jira Script (scripts/complete_pipeline_solution.py)
- Line 1114-1115: Get Docker Hub image information from environment
- Line 1128-1142: Build Docker Hub info section with image names and link
- Line 1151: Insert Docker Hub info into deployment section

## How It Works

1. **Build**: Docker image is built with tag `pipeline-registry/repo-name:run_number`
2. **Push to Docker Hub**: 
   - Image is pushed to `docker.io/docker-username/repo-name:run_number`
   - Image is also pushed as `docker.io/docker-username/repo-name:latest`
3. **Jira Issue**: Docker Hub image details are included in the deployment section

## Jira Issue Will Show

The Jira issue will now include:

```
|Docker Hub Image|`docker.io/username/repo-name:123`|
|Docker Hub (Latest)|`docker.io/username/repo-name:latest`|
|DockerHub URL|[üê≥ View on Docker Hub|https://hub.docker.com/r/username/repo-name]|
```

## Required GitHub Secrets

Add these secrets to your repository:

```
DOCKER_USERNAME - Your Docker Hub username
DOCKER_PASSWORD - Your Docker Hub password or access token
```

## Result

Now when you run the scan-external-repos workflow:
1. ‚úÖ Builds Docker image from the repository
2. ‚úÖ Pushes to Docker Hub with versioned and latest tags
3. ‚úÖ Deploys to Kubernetes
4. ‚úÖ Creates Jira issue with:
   - Docker Hub image URLs
   - Kubernetes deployment details
   - Access URLs
   - All scan results

The Jira issue will have all the information about where the Docker image is stored on Docker Hub!
