# Pipeline Trigger Guide

## 🎯 **Fixed! Pipeline Triggers Now Work Correctly**

### **Before (Problem):**
- ❌ Both pipelines triggered when you pushed `repos-to-scan.yaml`
- ❌ `basic-pipeline.yml` ran on ALL file changes
- ❌ `scan-external-repos.yml` also ran on `repos-to-scan.yaml` changes
- ❌ Confusion about which pipeline was running

### **After (Solution):**
- ✅ **`basic-pipeline.yml`** - Ignores `repos-to-scan.yaml` changes
- ✅ **`scan-external-repos.yml`** - Only runs on `repos-to-scan.yaml` changes
- ✅ Clear separation of pipeline purposes

---

## 📋 **Pipeline Trigger Rules:**

### **1. Basic ML Pipeline (`basic-pipeline.yml`)**
**Triggers when:**
- ✅ Any file changes (except `repos-to-scan.yaml`)
- ✅ Manual workflow dispatch
- ❌ **DOES NOT** trigger on `repos-to-scan.yaml` changes

**Purpose:** Your main ML pipeline for your own code

### **2. External Repository Scanner (`scan-external-repos.yml`)**
**Triggers when:**
- ✅ Only `repos-to-scan.yaml` file changes
- ✅ Manual workflow dispatch
- ❌ **DOES NOT** trigger on other file changes

**Purpose:** Scan external repositories listed in `repos-to-scan.yaml`

---

## 🚀 **Current Configuration:**

### **Repository Being Scanned:**
- **URL:** https://github.com/OzJasonGit/PFBD
- **Name:** pfbd-project
- **Branch:** master
- **Scan Type:** full

### **What Will Happen:**
1. **Only** `scan-external-repos.yml` will trigger
2. **No** `basic-pipeline.yml` will run
3. External repository `PFBD` will be scanned with full comprehensive pipeline
4. Results will appear in Grafana dashboard
5. Jira issue will be created with PFBD scan results

---

## 🎯 **Test Results:**

When you push changes to `repos-to-scan.yaml`:
- ✅ **Expected:** Only "Enhanced External Repository Scanner" runs
- ❌ **Not Expected:** "Working ML Pipeline" should NOT run

---

## 📊 **Monitor Results:**

1. **GitHub Actions:** https://github.com/almightymoon/Pipeline/actions
2. **Grafana Dashboard:** http://213.109.162.134:30102/d/9f0568b8-30a1-4306-ae44-f2f05a7c90d2/pipeline-dashboard-real-data
3. **Jira Issues:** https://faniqueprimus.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/KAN/boards/1

**The pipeline trigger issue is now fixed!** 🎉
