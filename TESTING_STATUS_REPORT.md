# Testing Status Report

## Current Testing Implementation

### ✅ **Unit Testing** - YES, Implemented

**Location:** `.github/workflows/scan-external-repos.yml` (Lines 344-377)

**What it does:**
- ✅ Runs Python unit tests (pytest, unittest)
- ✅ Runs Node.js unit tests (npm test)
- ✅ Runs Go unit tests (go test)
- ✅ Automatically discovers test files

**Issues Found:**
- ⚠️ Uses `|| echo` which doesn't fail the pipeline if tests don't exist
- ⚠️ May not run tests in `tests/` directory for external repos

**Example:**
```bash
python -m pytest tests/ -v
npm test
go test ./...
```

---

### ✅ **Integration Testing** - YES, Implemented

**Location:** `.github/workflows/scan-external-repos.yml` (Lines 379-407)

**What it does:**
- ✅ Looks for integration test directories: `tests/integration`, `integration-tests`, `test/integration`
- ✅ Runs Python integration tests (pytest)
- ✅ Runs Node.js integration tests (npm run test:integration)

**Issues Found:**
- ⚠️ Only runs if specific directories found
- ⚠️ Doesn't fail pipeline if integration tests fail

---

### ⚠️ **Performance/Load Testing** - PARTIALLY Implemented

**Location:** `.github/workflows/scan-external-repos.yml` (Lines 412-443)

**What it does:**
- ✅ Looks for performance test files (`*perf*`, `*load*`, `*benchmark*`)
- ✅ Runs Locust if `locustfile.py` exists (10 users, 2 spawn rate, 30s)
- ✅ Runs pytest-benchmark if found
- ✅ Runs Node.js performance tests (npm run perf)

**Issues Found:**
- ⚠️ Only runs if specific files found
- ⚠️ Basic load test (10 users, not very stressful)
- ⚠️ Locust must be installed and configured

**Your Test Files:**
- ✅ `tests/performance/load-test.js` - K6 load test (good!)
- ✅ `tests/performance/artillery-config.yml` - Artillery config (good!)
- ❌ **BUT**: These are not being automatically executed!

---

### ❌ **Stress Testing** - NOT Fully Implemented

**What I Found:**
- ✅ Stress test scenario exists in `tests/performance/load-test.js` (lines 173-183)
  - Ramp to 20 users
  - 5 minute sustained load
  - More lenient thresholds
- ❌ **NOT being automatically executed**
- ❌ Workflow doesn't run K6 or Artillery

**Current Workflow:**
- Only runs Locust if `locustfile.py` exists
- Doesn't run K6 or Artillery
- Stress scenario defined but not executed

---

## What's Missing

### 1. **K6 Stress Testing Not Automated**
Your `load-test.js` has stress test config but workflow doesn't run it.

### 2. **Artillery Not Automated**
Your `artillery-config.yml` exists but workflow doesn't run it.

### 3. **Test Failure Handling**
Tests use `|| echo` so failures don't stop the pipeline.

### 4. **External Repo Tests**
Tests in your `tests/` directory may not run for external repos.

---

## Recommendations

### 1. Add K6 Stress Testing

Update workflow to run:
```bash
# Install K6
curl https://github.com/grafana/k6/releases/download/v0.47.0/k6-v0.47.0-linux-amd64.tar.gz -L | tar xvz
sudo mv k6-v0.47.0-linux-amd64/k6 /usr/local/bin/

# Run stress test
k6 run --env BASE_URL=$APP_URL tests/performance/load-test.js --vus 20 --duration 5m
```

### 2. Add Artillery Stress Testing

```bash
# Install Artillery
npm install -g artillery

# Run artillery
artillery run tests/performance/artillery-config.yml
```

### 3. Make Tests Fail Pipeline on Failure

Change:
```bash
# From:
pytest tests/ || echo "Tests failed"

# To:
pytest tests/ || exit 1
```

### 4. Run Tests Against Deployed Application

Currently tests may run against localhost. Should run against deployed app URL.

## Summary

| Test Type | Status | Automated | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-----------|-------|
| **Unit Tests** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | Works, but doesn't fail pipeline |
| **Integration Tests** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | Only if test directories exist |
| **Performance Tests** | ⚠️ Partial | ⚠️ Partial | Only Locust, not K6/Artillery |
| **Stress Tests** | ❌ No | ❌ No | Code exists but not executed |
| **Load Tests** | ⚠️ Basic | ⚠️ Basic | Only 10 users, not stressful |

---

## Next Steps

Would you like me to:
1. Add K6 stress testing to the workflow?
2. Add Artillery stress testing?
3. Fix test failure handling (make failures stop pipeline)?
4. Run tests against deployed application URLs?
5. Add dedicated stress test stage?
