# Repository Scanner Configuration
# Add repository URLs here to automatically scan them through the pipeline
# The pipeline will clone, build, test, and security scan each repository

repositories:
  # Example entries:
  # - url: https://github.com/username/repo-name
  #   name: friendly-name
  #   branch: main  # optional, defaults to main
  #   scan_type: full  # options: full, security-only, quick
  
  # Add your repositories below:
  # - url: https://github.com/almightymoon/docker-test-app-1 
  #   name: docker-test-app-1
  #   branch: main  
  #   scan_type: full   

  # - url: https://github.com/almightymoon/sample-docker-app.git
  #   name: sample-docker-app
  #   branch: main   # Changed from master to main   
  #   scan_type: full

    branch: main    
    scan_type: full
