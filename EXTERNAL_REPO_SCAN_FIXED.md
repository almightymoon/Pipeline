- Or manually: `gh workflow run "Scan External Repositories"`

### **3. Scan Process**
1. ✅ Clone external repository
2. ✅ Run Trivy security scan
3. ✅ Check for secrets and API keys
4. ✅ Analyze code quality (TODO, debug statements, large files)
5. ✅ Collect metrics (files, lines, size)

### **4. Jira Issue Creation**
Automatically creates issue with:
- 🔗 Repository name and link
- 🔒 Security scan results
- 📊 Code quality analysis
- 📈 Scan metrics
- 🔗 Links to Grafana dashboard and pipeline logs
