# 📊 Repository Dashboard System - Quick Reference

## ✅ ISSUE FIXED

**Problem:** Jira was linking to hardcoded neuropilot dashboard for all repositories  
**Solution:** Dynamic dashboard URLs - each repository gets its own dashboard and Jira link

---

## 🚀 Quick Start (3 Commands)

```bash
# 1. Configure your repository
vim repos-to-scan.yaml

# 2. Run your pipeline (scans repository)

# 3. Create dashboard and Jira ticket
python3 scripts/pipeline_complete.py
```

**Done!** Your Jira ticket now links to the correct repository-specific dashboard.

## 📊 What You Get

### For tensorflow-models:
- Dashboard: `http://213.109.162.134:30102/d/e03ed124-7224-1aeb-f53e-31d9ccf48a46/pipeline-dashboard-tensorflow-models`
- Jira: Links to tensorflow-models dashboard ✅

### For neuropilot-project:
- Dashboard: `http://213.109.162.134:30102/d/{unique-uid}/pipeline-dashboard-neuropilot-project`
- Jira: Links to neuropilot-project dashboard ✅

### For ANY repository:
- Dashboard: Automatically generated with unique UID
- Jira: Links to that repository's dashboard ✅

**No hardcoding!** Works for any repository automatically.

## 📁 Available Scripts

| Script | Purpose | When to Use |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `pipeline_complete.py` | **RECOMMENDED** - Complete workflow | After pipeline scan |
| `create_repo_dashboard_and_jira.py` | Full solution with detailed metrics | When you want all features |
| `create_jira_issue.py` | Updated - now uses dynamic URLs | Legacy Jira creation (updated) |
| `create-repo-dashboard.sh` | Easy dashboard creation | Manual dashboard creation |

---

## 🎯 Recommended Usage

### In Your Pipeline Workflow

Replace your current Jira creation step with:

```yaml
- name: Create Dashboard and Jira Issue
  run: python3 scripts/pipeline_complete.py
  env:
    JIRA_URL: ${{ secrets.JIRA_URL }}
    JIRA_EMAIL: ${{ secrets.JIRA_EMAIL }}
    JIRA_API_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.JIRA_API_TOKEN }}
    JIRA_PROJECT_KEY: ${{ secrets.JIRA_PROJECT_KEY }}
```

This ensures:
1. ✅ Dashboard is created with real-time metrics
2. ✅ Jira ticket links to the correct dashboard
3. ✅ Works for any repository (no hardcoding)

---

## 🔍 How It Works

```
Repository Name (e.g., "tensorflow-models")
    ↓
Generate Unique UID (e.g., "e03ed124-7224-1aeb-f53e-31d9ccf48a46")
    ↓
Create Dashboard URL
    ↓
Create Grafana Dashboard at that URL
    ↓
Create Jira Ticket with Dashboard Link
    ↓
✅ Jira links to correct repository dashboard
```

**Key Feature:** Same repository name always generates the same UID (consistent across runs)

## ✅ Verification

### Test the Fix:

```bash
# Test with tensorflow-models
python3 -c "
import hashlib
repo = 'tensorflow-models'
uid = hashlib.md5(repo.encode()).hexdigest()
uid = f'{uid[0:8]}-{uid[8:12]}-{uid[12:16]}-{uid[16:20]}-{uid[20:32]}'
print(f'Repository: {repo}')
print(f'Dashboard UID: {uid}')
print(f'URL: http://213.109.162.134:30102/d/{uid}/pipeline-dashboard-{repo}')
"
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Repository: tensorflow-models
Dashboard UID: e03ed124-7224-1aeb-f53e-31d9ccf48a46
URL: http://213.109.162.134:30102/d/e03ed124-7224-1aeb-f53e-31d9ccf48a46/pipeline-dashboard-tensorflow-models
```

✅ **This is the URL Jira will use!**
