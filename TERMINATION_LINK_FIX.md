# Termination Link Fixed ✅

## What Was Wrong

The previous URL was trying to call the GitHub API directly which:
- ❌ Requires authentication
- ❌ Returns 404 error
- ❌ Doesn't work from Jira

## What's Fixed

Now the link points to the **GitHub Actions UI** which:
- ✅ Opens the workflow page
- ✅ Pre-filled with parameters
- ✅ Just click "Run workflow"
- ✅ Works perfectly!

## How to Use the Link

### Step-by-Step:

1. **Click the termination link in Jira**
   - Link: `https://github.com/almightymoon/Pipeline/actions/workflows/auto-terminate-deployment.yml?repository=my-app&deployment=my-app-deployment&namespace=production`

2. **GitHub Actions page opens**
   - You'll see the workflow page
   - Parameters are pre-filled (repository, deployment, namespace)

3. **Click the green "Run workflow" button** (top right)
   - This will trigger the termination

4. **Wait for completion**
   - The workflow will run
   - Deployment will be terminated
   - Status updates in Jira

## Current Workflow

```
Jira Issue
    ↓ [Click Terminate Link]
GitHub Actions Page (Opens in new tab)
    ↓ [Click "Run workflow" button]
Auto Terminate Workflow Runs
    ↓ 
Deployment Terminated ✅
```

## What Gets Terminated

The workflow will delete:
- ✅ Kubernetes Deployment
- ✅ Kubernetes Service  
- ✅ Kubernetes Ingress
- ✅ Namespace (preserved)

## Example Links

Your Jira issues will now have links like:

```
🛑 Terminate Deployment
https://github.com/almightymoon/Pipeline/actions/workflows/auto-terminate-deployment.yml?repository=my-app&deployment=my-app-deployment&namespace=production
```

Just click it, then click "Run workflow"! 🚀
