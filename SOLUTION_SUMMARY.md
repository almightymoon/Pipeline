# ✅ SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED - Repository-Specific Dashboards

## 🎯 Your Request

> "I want it to create a new dashboard for each pipeline run pulling the realtime data from the pipeline and it should update the jira url to point it to the exact dashboard everytime"
>
> "if i ran repo 1 it should create a dashboard and update the jira to point it to repo 1 dashboard in grafana"
>
> "and if i ran repo 2 it should create a dashboard and update the jira to point it to repo 2 dashboard in grafana"

## ✅ SOLUTION DELIVERED

### What Was Built

A complete automated system that:
1. ✅ Creates a **unique dashboard** for each repository
2. ✅ Pulls **real-time data** from the pipeline
3. ✅ Updates **Jira tickets** with the exact dashboard URL
4. ✅ Uses the **same dashboard template** you provided

---

## 📊 How It Works

### Example 1: Running Repo 1 (tensorflow-models)

**Step 1: Configure Repository**
```yaml
# repos-to-scan.yaml
repositories:
  - url: https://github.com/tensorflow/models
    name: tensorflow-models
    branch: master
    scan_type: full
```

**Step 2: Run Pipeline**
```bash
# Pipeline runs and scans tensorflow-models
# Collects security vulnerabilities, code quality, test results
```

**Step 3: Create Dashboard & Update Jira**
```bash
./create-repo-dashboard.sh
```

**Result:**
```
✅ DASHBOARD CREATED SUCCESSFULLY!
Repository: tensorflow-models
Dashboard URL: http://213.109.162.134:30102/d/e03ed124-7224-1aeb-f53e-31d9ccf48a46/pipeline-dashboard-tensorflow-models
Dashboard UID: e03ed124-7224-1aeb-f53e-31d9ccf48a46

**Step 2: Run Pipeline**
```bash
# Pipeline runs and scans Neuropilot-project
# Collects security vulnerabilities, code quality, test results
```

**Step 3: Create Dashboard & Update Jira**
```bash
./create-repo-dashboard.sh
```

**Result:**
```

   ```json
   {
     "Results": [
       {
         "Vulnerabilities": [
           {"Severity": "CRITICAL"},
           {"Severity": "HIGH"}
         ]
       }
     ]
   }
   ```
