# Check Workflow Status

Your webhook triggered the GitHub workflow! ✅

## Check if Workflow Ran

1. Go to: https://github.com/almightymoon/Pipeline/actions
2. Look for "Auto Terminate Deployment" workflow
3. Check if it ran (should show green checkmark if successful)

## If Workflow Didn't Run

The issue is that the webhook calls the `dispatches` API but the workflow is set to `workflow_dispatch` instead of `repository_dispatch`.

## Quick Fix Options

### Option 1: Manually run the workflow
1. Go to: https://github.com/almightymoon/Pipeline/actions/workflows/auto-terminate-deployment.yml
2. Click "Run workflow"
3. Fill in:
   - repository: my-app
   - deployment: my-app-deployment
   - namespace: default
4. Click "Run workflow" button

### Option 2: Check the webhook server logs
On your VPS:
```bash
tail -f webhook.log
```

You should see the workflow trigger response.

## What Should Happen

1. Webhook receives request ✅ (you saw the success message)
2. Webhook calls GitHub API ✅
3. GitHub creates workflow run ⚠️ (needs verification)
4. Workflow deletes Kubernetes resources ⏳ (check logs)

Check the GitHub Actions page to see if the workflow actually ran!
