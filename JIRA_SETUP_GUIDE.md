# 🔧 Jira Integration Setup Guide

## 🐛 Problem Identified

**Issue:** Pipeline ran successfully but no Jira message was created  
**Root Cause:** Missing Jira environment variables

---

## ✅ What's Working

- ✅ **YAML Syntax Fixed:** `repos-to-scan.yaml` now has correct syntax
- ✅ **Dashboard Created:** `iman_tiles` dashboard created successfully
- ✅ **Pipeline Running:** Repository scanning works correctly

**Dashboard URL:** `http://213.109.162.134:30102/d/f7f35c08-aa63-0711-303d-9fbbd26e5153/pipeline-dashboard-iman-tiles`

## 🔧 Missing: Jira Configuration

### **Required Environment Variables:**

```bash
JIRA_URL=your-domain.atlassian.net
JIRA_EMAIL=your-email@example.com
JIRA_API_TOKEN=your-api-token
JIRA_PROJECT_KEY=PROJECT
```

## 🚀 How to Set Up Jira Integration

### **Step 1: Get Jira API Token**

1. Go to [Atlassian Account Settings](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens)
2. Click **"Create API token"**
3. Give it a name (e.g., "Pipeline Integration")
4. Copy the generated token

### **Step 2: Set Environment Variables**

#### **Option A: Set in GitHub Secrets (Recommended)**

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**
3. Add these secrets:
   - `JIRA_URL`: `your-domain.atlassian.net`
   - `JIRA_EMAIL`: `your-email@example.com`
   - `JIRA_API_TOKEN`: `your-api-token`
   - `JIRA_PROJECT_KEY`: `PROJECT`

#### **Option B: Set Locally (For Testing)**

```bash
export JIRA_URL="your-domain.atlassian.net"
export JIRA_EMAIL="your-email@example.com"
export JIRA_API_TOKEN="your-api-token"
export JIRA_PROJECT_KEY="PROJECT"
```

### **Step 3: Test Jira Integration**

```bash
# Test with environment variables set
python3 scripts/complete_pipeline_solution.py
```

   export JIRA_EMAIL="your-email@example.com"
   export JIRA_API_TOKEN="your-api-token"

   python3 scripts/complete_pipeline_solution.py
   ```

3. **Expected result:**
   ```
   ✅ DASHBOARD CREATED WITH REAL DATA!
   ✅ JIRA ISSUE CREATED SUCCESSFULLY!
   ```

### **If you don't have Jira:**

The dashboard is already created and working! You can:
- ✅ View the dashboard: `http://213.109.162.134:30102/d/f7f35c08-aa63-0711-303d-9fbbd26e5153/pipeline-dashboard-iman-tiles`
- ✅ Use the pipeline without Jira integration
- ✅ Set up Jira later when needed

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### **Check Environment Variables:**
```bash
echo "JIRA_URL: ${JIRA_URL:-'NOT SET'}"
echo "JIRA_EMAIL: ${JIRA_EMAIL:-'NOT SET'}"
echo "JIRA_API_TOKEN: ${JIRA_API_TOKEN:-'NOT SET'}"
echo "JIRA_PROJECT_KEY: ${JIRA_PROJECT_KEY:-'NOT SET'}"
```

### **Test Jira Connection:**
```bash
curl -u "$JIRA_EMAIL:$JIRA_API_TOKEN" \
  "https://$JIRA_URL/rest/api/2/myself"
```
